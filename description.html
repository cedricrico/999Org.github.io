            <h3>What is bullying</h3>
            <p>Bullying is unwanted,<br>
                aggressive behavior among school aged children that involves a real or perceived power imbalance. The behavior is repeated,<br>
                 or has the potential to be repeated, over time. Both kids who are bullied and who bully others may have serious,
                  <br>lasting problems.

                  <br>
                    
               -"An Imbalance of Power":<br>
               Kids who bully use their power—such as physical strength, access to embarrassing information,<br>
                or popularity—to control or harm others. Power imbalances can change over time and in different situations, even if they involve the same people.

               <br>
               Repetition: Bullying behaviors happen more than once or have the potential to happen more than once.
